"Medical Supplies" are a group of [items](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Items) that provide you with health (along with other benefits) when used.

## Obtaining
All medical supplies are crafted in the [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table), after unlocking the "First Aid" research.

## Uses

All medical supplies heal you, however the amount depends on which tier it is.

Tier 1 (Splint/Rag): Heals 2 hearts
Tier 2 (Bandage): Heals 4 hearts + Extinguishes fire
Tier 3 (Vitamins/Medicine): Heals 4 hearts + Extinguishes fire + Removes poison, wither and radiation

## Tips

Medicine takes the longest to use, so it may not be the best option in a quick battle (like PvP).
Medicine is also the only unstackable medical supply out of the 5.
