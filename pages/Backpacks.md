Backpacks are a group of items that give additional storage space when right clicked, acting like a portable chest.

## Obtaining
All backpacks (except ender and soulbound) are crafted at an enhanced crafting table, using the previous backpack (or a chest), after unlocking the research for it. Ender and soulbound backpacks are crafted at a magic 

Small Backpack, Backpack and Large Backpack are all unlocked with the "Backpacks" research. All other backpacks are unlocked individually.

## Usage
Right clicking on a backpack will bring up a portable chest, with the size depending on which backpack you use.
Small Backpack -> 9 slots
Backpack -> 18 slots
Large Backpack -> 27 slots
Woven Backpack -> 36 slots
Soulbound Backpack -> 36 slots
Gilded Backpack -> 45 slots
Radiant Backpack -> 54 slots (double chest)
Ender Backpack -> opens ender chest (27)

## Special Properties
Soulbound Backpacks are kept on you upon dying (like all soulbound items), and ender backpacks bring up an ender chest (meaning that they are shared with other ender backpacks/chests)
